# JamLegend shutting down

Speaking of different ways of experiencing music, JamLegend is shutting down. This makes me incredibly sad.

For those who don’t know, JamLegend is a social, browser-based guitar hero style game. In all honesty, I haven’t had time or felt like playing JamLegend lately, especially since I have customs in Rock Band 2 now, but it was always there for me when I wanted to play something a little different. It was a great way for me personally to discover music artists I would otherwise never be introduced to, at the very least, as well as being fun.

Also, what does this mean for the music game genre? Guitar Hero is gone, and the various clones all seem to be shutting down around it. Rock Band looks like it’s still marching on, but it seems that people in general have dropped the music game fad.

I love music and rhythm games. This news makes me sad.
