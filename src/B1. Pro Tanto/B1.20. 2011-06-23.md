# Martyrdom sucks: why it's so wonderful

I just finished my second play-through of what has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time. An iOS-only game called Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP. That's "EP" in the same way that a musician would release an EP. And while there's no rhythm component to this, the music does play a big part. The music is from a fella named Jim Guthrie, who I'd never heard of until this game, but I might look up. I love the sworcery soundtrack.

But music is only part of the charm. Some of it is the blocky pixel graphics, that are nostalgic for games past. The characters remind me of old Sierra adventure games. The colors are generally of a darker nature and really help to set the mood of the scenes. Zooming out and panning around reveal beautiful, surprisingly detailed and beautiful environments.

So it looks good and sounds good, but that's not enough to make it a good game. It's hard to pin it down exactly. There's an element of emotional involvement in the story, which in itself is sort of vague and generic, but at the same time wonderful, with an emotional ending.
