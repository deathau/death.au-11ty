My new idea for journaling and note taking is old news to most: Index cards!
I bought myself a stack of double-sided, lined index cards from Officeworks, and I plan to try and take small breaks throughout my day and just write what's going on in my head.
In the past, I've been somewhat resistant to pen-and-paper journaling, because I have difficulty trusting that as a storage medium, and digitising is a pain.
But this time I plan to try a different approach.
