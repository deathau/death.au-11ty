G'day, Neighbours!

Update 0.9.9 has been published to the Google Play store (pending Google's review).

This update adds the ability to view and manage pastebin entries through the in-app profile page. Pastes will also show up in the feed.  
Also added: Edit your statuslog bio, character count on statuses, light theme (based on OS preference) and some minor color / style tweaks.

As always, feedback is welcome via [neighbourhood@omg.lol](mailto:neighbourhood@omg.lol)
