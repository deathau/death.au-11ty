I'm looking into microblog.pub ( [@microblogpub@microblog.pub](https://microblog.pub){.mention target="_blank"} @microblogpub ) again. It just seems so close to where I want to end up. I want my website to also be my front-end to the [#fediverse](/tag/fediverse){.tag}. Microblog.pub basically is that, but there's no real way to add static pages just yet.

I've been playing around with customizing templates and CSS to get the site looking similar to my current home page, and it's working well so far.
