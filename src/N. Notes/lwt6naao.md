I think my next hyperfocus is going to be building a multiplatform status.log equivalent.

I have a desire to try and build a [#MAUI](/tag/maui){.tag} [#Blazor](/tag/blazor){.tag} hybrid app, and working with the [#omg.lol](/tag/omg.lol){.tag} API seems pretty fun. Plus, I'm a bit jealous that the current app is apple-only

I couldn't see any docs on the [#some.pics](/tag/some){.tag} API, and I'll have to figure out the OAuth flow, but surely it shouldn't be hard?
