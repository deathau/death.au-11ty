A new version of [#Wavebox](/tag/wavebox){.tag} has afforded me the incentive to reorganise all my apps/tabs.

In doing so, I realised something: apart from numbering, it's organised like a [#JohnnyDecimal](/tag/johnny-decimal){.tag} system!
I've got Spaces for Areas, Groups for Categories and "Apps" and/or pinned tabs as individual ID points. All other tabs are temporary and will be trashed when I close the browser.
