It's that time of year where one reflects on the year that has passed and looks forward to the new one. A lot of people like to set a "theme" for the new year, which is something I've not done before.

But next year, I think I'd like to set a theme of [#focus](/tag/focus){.tag}

Focus is something I constantly struggle with, and I *really* need to step up my game.

So how does one practice focus? What does that even mean? That is what I'm setting out to discover.
