G'day, Neighbours!

Update 0.9.7 has been published to the Google Play store.  
(don't worry about missing version numbers, I adjusted how I was doing them)

This update brings the ability to edit your web/profile page. Including choosing a theme!  
You can also upload a new profile picture through the app.
