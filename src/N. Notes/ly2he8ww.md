G'day Neighbours!  
I've published an open beta of my new Neighbourhood.omg.lol app. It's ready for any and all Android users to try out!
I've also set up a sale so the app will be free for a week, but I couldn't start the sale immediately, so it will be free from tomorrow.

I'm looking for honest feedback. What works, what doesn't, what needs improvement. I don't exactly have bug tracking or anything set up yet, so for now feel free to ping me on Mastodon, or shoot an email to neighbourhood@omg.lol

I also have a roadmap on the /now page (https://neighbourhood.omg.lol/now) if you're interested.
