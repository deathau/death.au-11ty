This is my KBDCraft 60% typewriter.

Built from a Kit Lilith, with pieces from case Adam, along with some purchased parts and some I just had lying around. Plus some round "typewriter" keycaps from AliExpress.

It's also mostly hollow, so theoretically I could install a small PC like a Raspberry Pi or a NUC in there. But for now, it's good to use with a tablet.
