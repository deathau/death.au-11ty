An unforeseen benefit of assigning [#JohnnyDecimal](/tag/johnnydecimal){.tag} IDs to everything (and cleanly distinguishing between what I consider "public" and "private" stuff) is that I can refer to private stuff in public without actually mentioning it.

For example, I can complain about how complex `[401.12]` is and how hard it is to debug, and as long as I don't get into specifics, it's perfectly fine.
