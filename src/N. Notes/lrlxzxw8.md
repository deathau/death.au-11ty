Most mood trackers I've seen just rank from negative to positive, and I feel like there's a lot of nuance there that is lost.

If I have a negative day, it doesn't necessarily mean I was ☹️. I might've been angry or irritable or just sick.

Has anyone seen any good alternatives?

It seems like a problem that is likely solved somewhere already.
