G'day neighbours!
It's been a while...

But I wanted to share that version 1.0.0 of Neighbourhood.omg.lol is live on the Google Play Store!
If you're already using the app, there are no major changes. If you're not though, it's a great time to jump on board! Statuses, pics, pastes and all that good omg.lol stuff is here and easily accessible.

Any feedback? Shoot me a message: neighbourhood@omg.lol
