Oh no! My 20-year-old minidisc-capable stereo ([https://www.minidisc.wiki/equipment/sony/bookshelf/cmt-cp500md](https://www.minidisc.wiki/equipment/sony/bookshelf/cmt-cp500md)) looks like it might have given up.
There was an electrical storm yesterday, and one bolt of lightning did hit quite close to home, but no breakers or anything seemed to be tripped, and nothing else has malfunctioned.
But when I try to turn the stereo on, the backlight does not turn on, it flashes "STANDBY" and then turns off again.
Hopefully there's something I can do to save it...
