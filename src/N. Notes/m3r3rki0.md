Charlie and the Chocolate factory, but rewritten in the modern day, with modern day sensibilities. 
New kids, new fantastic ways for them to get their comeuppance. 

Plot twist: it's a sequel. There are stories and legends of what happened to kids in the factory many years ago, including that one kid who never returned and whose whole family  disappeared soon after. Story morphs into horror-esque.

Double plot twist "Willy Wonka" is just old Charlie.
