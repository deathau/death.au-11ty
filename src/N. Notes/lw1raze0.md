Sometimes I just can't help myself. My https://deathau.weblog.lol site now has a fediverse "login" â€” you enter fediverse handle and it will look up your avatar and subscribe link via webfinger, saving those to local storage.
Then, it replaces all the links to my friendica instance with links to that same post in *your* instance (as per the subscribe link).

I just need to figure out how to get the reply/reblog/like counts of my posts in there, too.
