I tried to write a post/article today about a CSS-only theme toggle I made for my website. But rather than draft it in Obsidian like usual, I wrote it directly in Friendica. Then I tried to attach an image and the whole tab locked up and I lost the lot.
Very disheartening.
Then I wondered why I'm posting "articles" here when I have my own website. So now I'm finding my old attempts at blogs and newsletters and translating them to Markdown so I can host them *all* on my website...
