It's not static, but I've added JavaScript to load replies to my weblog.lol posts (the ones that are linked to a friendica post, anyway). So you can visit the the weblog and see the conversation as a comments thread, then link off to interact with the conversation on your own instance (if you "log in" first).

I really should do a full write-up of what I've done with my site so far... Maybe after I commit to putting it on my main domain.
