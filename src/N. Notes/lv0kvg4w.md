Does anyone know of a good [#mobile](/tag/mobile){.tag} [#keyboard](/tag/keyboard){.tag} that I can use hand-held? I want to be able to type on something with actual tactile feedback (I hate touch screen keyboards) but doesn't sacrifice portability by having to set the phone down somewhere while I type.  
(My brain seems to be on overload right now)
