My current obsession has been thinking about [#ActivityPub](/tag/activity-pub){.tag} and owning my own space and data. I've been tossing around ideas for how to host my own identity on my own server/domain while still hosting a static site on the same domain, as well as decoupling that identity from any particular app or instance.

... And you know what? [#bluesky](/tag/bluesky){.tag} seems to solve all these problems (in theory - it's still in the process of being built)
