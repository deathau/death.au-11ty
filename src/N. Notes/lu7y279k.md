This is still very raw and not looking great or anything, but I'm experimenting with using the [#mastodon](/tag/mastodon){.tag} API built into [#friendica](/tag/friendica){.tag} to get my [#ActivityPub](/tag/activitypub){.tag} posts and show them on my static [#eleventy](/tag/eleventy){.tag} website.

death.id.au/posts/

Because it's static, this post won't appear on it, but it should next time I rebuild.  
Eventually, I want to be able to log in and reply, see my feeds, and post directly from my website. Friendica is probably overkill as a back-end, but it's what I have right now.
