If the [#AppleVisionPro](/tag/apple-vision-pro){.tag} is the next "iPhone moment"...  
Then I'll wait for the 3rd gen.  
Or the cheaper, more open Android equivalent.

I could wait for Microsoft's answer, but it would probably be too late and fail to garner support from developers, even if it is better than the alternatives.
