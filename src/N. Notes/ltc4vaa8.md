Because my OBTF was so ramble-y, I'm going to accept that and even lean into it on my index cards. Then, I'm going to really try and implement a daily review routine, where I skim my index cards at the end of the day, pull out, digitise and re-word any important notes and write myself a special tomorrow index which lists what I need to be doing tomorrow.
I don't know how well it's going to work, or how well I will stick to it, but I have the stack of cards now, so here I go.
