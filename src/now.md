# What am I up to these days?

- 💼 Looking for work, mostly. Are you hiring? Check out my [CV](https://death.id.au/cv/).
- 🌐 Playing around with my website and my online identity via ActivityPub.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Looking after my kids, who are 4 and 9 this year.
- ⌨️ Building and tinkering with [KBDCraft](https://kbdcraft.store/user/signUp?referral_code=K34SSH35L&amp;source_type=member_plugin_referral&amp;slt=member_plugin_referral&amp;ref=death.id.au) Lego mechanical keyboards.
- 🎲 Playing D&D every couple of weeks and exploring other TTRPGs in my own time.
- 📖 Reading (or, more accurately, listening to) [The Stormlight Archive](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49075-the-stormlight-archive) series by [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson).
- 🧑‍💻 Exploring Linux (kubuntu) as my new daily driver OS.
- 🎮 I've kind of fallen off of video games, recently. Nothing in particular is grabbing my attention.
