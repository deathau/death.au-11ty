# What am I up to these days?

- 💼 Working at my new job with [SWiM Communications](https://www.swim.com.au/).
- 🌐 Playing around with my website and my online identity via ActivityPub.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Looking after my kids, who are 4 and 9 this year.
- ⌨️ Building and tinkering with [KBDCraft](https://kbdcraft.store/user/signUp?referral_code=K34SSH35L&source_type=member_plugin_referral&slt=member_plugin_referral&ref=death.id.au) Lego mechanical keyboards.
- 🎲 Playing D&D every couple of weeks and exploring other TTRPGs in my own time.
- 📖 Reading (or, more accurately, listening to) [The Stormlight Archive](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49075-the-stormlight-archive) series by [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson).
- 🧑‍💻 Exploring Linux (kubuntu) as my new daily driver OS.
- 🎮 I've been exploring a little in [Blue Prince](https://www.blueprincegame.com/), Cleaning up in [Power Wash Simulator 2](https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2), and playing matches in [Marvel Snap](https://marvelsnap.com/)
