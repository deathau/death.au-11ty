# Pathogen Attack!

This was a javascript-based online game, built for the Gene Technology Access Centre
([GTAC](https://gtac.edu.au/)). I was mainly involved in the design phase, as opposed
to the development, but what a design phase it was!

The goal of this game was to help teach VCE level students about the human immune
system through an interactive game. Of course, this meant that the first step was to
learn all about the human immune system. Over a period of many weeks, there were many
discussions with the GTAC educators, alongside actual immunology experts, to get a
handle on which cells play a role in the immune system and their function.

There was a lot of back and forth, gaining knowledge, assembling it and then
confirming it with the experts. In the process, I think even the educators learned new
things.

Afterwards, we had to translate the cells and their processes into game mechanics â€”
attacking invading pathogens, recognising pathogens and utilizing the lymphatic nodes 
to produce appropriate T-Cells, sending out different forms of Dendritic Cells and 
acrophages... In the end it became an interesting (and hopefully entertaining)
real-time strategy game. And I learned a lot about the immune system in the process.
